## Challenge Description

Why did my Samurai friend become a stand-up comedian after The war?

BEcause after Getting his legs cut, his original height wasn't what it used to be! Now, seeking a new path and hiding his pain behind humor, he's slicing through jokes instead of foes, making everyone laugh while standing tall in spirit!

## Solution

This jpg file was given to us:

I used all kinds of steganography tools on it but all in vain.

When I use **`steghide`** it says this:

After doing some research, I came across this [article](https://hackmd.io/@XeusNguyen/S1DdU66Zo) where I learned about the width and height bytes of a JPG file.

You can read the following paragraph if you still don't understand:

So, it order to restore the original picture, I have to adjust its bytes that control its heights. Because in the description of the challenge they are repeatedly mentioning height of the warrior.

Opened the jpg file in **`hexeditor`**:

I increased it from 06 â†’ 07:

Here is the result:

I increased it again by 1:

Here is the result:

Now as we have password for **`steghide`**, use following command to extract the hidden data:

```python
steghide --extract -sf challenge.jpg
```

We got the **`flag.txt`**:

Flag:

```
AUCSS{th3se_$tup1d_h3adeRs_w1th_h3x_3d1t}
```
