## Level 0:

**The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever you find a password for a level, use SSH (on port 2220) to log into that level and continue the game.**

```:Password
NH2SXQwcBdpmTEzi3bvBHMM9H66vVXjL
```

#### Explanation

Use this command to login to the server:

```bash:ssh-command
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

```:ssh-password
bandit0
```

![Login](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/login.png)

Use `ls` to see a list of all files and directories. You will see the **readme** file there. Use `cat` to display its contents.

![Level-0](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level0-1.png)

---

## Level 01:

**The password for the next level is stored in a file called `-` located in the home directory**

```:Password
rRGizSaX8Mk1RTb1CNQoXTcYZWU6lgzi
```

#### Explanation:

Use any of these commands:

```bash
cat ←
```

OR

```bash
cat ./-
```

![Level-1](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level1-1.png)

---

## Level 02:

**The password for the next level is stored in a file called spaces in this filename located in the home directory.**

```:Password
aBZ0W5EmUfAf7kHTQeOwd8bauFJ2lAiG
```

#### Explanation:

Type `cat spaces` then press tab button to get actual name: `spaces\ in\ this\ filename.`

```bash
cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
```

The backslashes (`\`) in this command are used as escape operators to escape spaces and instruct `cat` to treat them as part of the filename rather than as terminators.

![Level-2](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level2-1.png)

---

## Level 03:

**The password for the next level is stored in a hidden file in the inhere directory.**

```:Password
2EW7BBsr6aMMoJ2HjW067dm8EgX26xNe
```

#### Explanation:

```bash
cd inhere
```

We use `ls` with `-a` flag to also list hidden files and directories:

```bash
ls -a
```

Here, is the hidden file `.hidden`. Use `cat` to print its content on the terminal:

```bash
cat .hidden
```

![Level-3](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level3-1.png)

---

## Level 04:

**The password for the next level is stored in the only human-readable file in the inhere directory.**

**(Tip: If your terminal is messed up, try the “reset” command.)**

```bash:Password
lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR
```

#### Explanation:

To access the content of all 10 files in this directory, simply use `cat` command along with the wildcard `*`. The wildcard instructs the system to include all files within the specified directory:

```bash
cat ./-file0*
```

`./`: This represents the current directory.

`-file0*`: This part refers to a file or files whose names start with **-file0** in the current directory, with the `*` acting as a wildcard character, matching any characters that follow "file0".

So, this command will display the contents of all files in the current directory whose names begin with **-file0**.

![Level-4](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level4-1.png)

---

## Level 05:

**The password for the next level is stored in a file somewhere under cd inthe inhere directory and has all of the following properties:**

- **human-readable**

- **1033 bytes in size**

- **not executable**

```:Password
P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU
```

#### Explanation:

Command that I used:

```bash
find ~/inhere -type f -readable -size 1033c ! -executable
```

`~/inhere`: This specifies the directory where the search will take place.

`-type f`: This option instructs find to only consider files (not directories).

`-readable`: This flag ensures that only files that are readable by the user executing the command are considered.

`-size 1033c`: This specifies the size of the files to search for. Here, it looks for files with a size of exactly 1033 bytes (`c`).

`! -executable`: This part of the command uses the `!` operator to negate the -executable condition. So, it excludes files that are executable.

![Level-5](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level5-1.png)

And now cat that file out:

![Level-5](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level5-2.png)

---

## Level 06:

**The password for the next level is stored somewhere on the server and has all of the following properties:**

- **owned by user bandit7**

- **owned by group bandit6**

- **33 bytes in size**

```:Password
z7WtoNQU2XfjmMtWA8u5rN4vzqu4v99S
```

#### Explanation:

Command that I used:

```bash
find / -type f -user bandit7 -group bandit6 -size 33c 2>/dev/null
```

`/`: This specifies the starting directory for the search. In this case, it starts from the root directory, searching the entire filesystem.

`-type f`: This option specifies that only files should be considered (not directories).

`-user bandit7`: This option specifies that the files must be owned by the user **bandit7**.

`-group bandit6`: This option specifies that the files must belong to the group **bandit6**.

`-size 33c`: This option specifies that the files must have a size of 33 bytes.

`2>/dev/null`: This redirects any error messages generated during the search to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing them.

So, altogether the command is searching the entire filesystem for regular files owned by user **bandit7**, belonging to group **bandit6** and having a size of 33 bytes. Any errors encountered during the search are discarded.

![Level-6](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level6-1.png)

And now cat that file out:

![Level-6](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level6-2.png)

---

## Level 07:

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt next to the word millionth.**

```:Password
TESKZC0XvTetK0S9xNwm25STk5iWrBvP
```

#### Explanation:

I used `grep` to filter out line that contains word "millionth". Command that I used:

```bash
cat data.txt | grep "millionth"
```

`|`: This is known as a pipe operator. It takes the output of the command on its left (`cat data.txt` in this case) and sends it as input to the command on its right (`grep "millionth"`).

Output:

![Level-7](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level7-1.png)

---

## Level 08:

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt and is the only line of text that occurs only once.**

```:Password
EN632PlfYiZbn3PhVK3XOGSlNInNE00t
```

#### Explanation:

For this challenge I was read manual of `uniq` command and saw this:

![Level-8](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level8-1.png)

So the final command that I used:

```bash
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

![Level-8](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level8-2.png)

---

## Level 09:

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt in one of the few human-readable strings, preceded by several ‘=’ characters.**

```:Password
G7w8LIi6J3kTb8A7j9LgrywtEUlyyp6s
```

#### Explanation:

I used `strings` command to find for strings (human-readable) in data.txt:

```bash
strings data.txt | grep "=="
```

![Level-9](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level9-1.png)

---

## Level 10:

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which contains base64 encoded data.**

```:Password
6zPeziLdR2RKNdNYFNb6nVCKzphlXHBM
```

#### Explanation:

This is how you can decode a base64 encoded string, in linux:

```bash
base64 -d data.txt
```

`-d`: This option is used to decode a base64 encoded data.

![Level-10](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level10-1.png)

---

## Level 11

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, where all lowercase (a-z) and uppercase (A-Z) letters have been rotated by 13 positions.**

```:Password
JVNBBFSmZwKKOP0XbFXOoW8chDz5yVRv
```

#### Explanation:

This is how you can decode a rot13 encoded string, in linux:

```bash
cat data.txt | tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'
```

`tr 'A-Za-z' 'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`: This command, tr (short for "translate" or "transliterate"), is used to replace characters in a stream of text.

- The first argument, `'A-Za-z'`, specifies the range of characters to be translated. Here, it covers all uppercase and lowercase letters in the English alphabet.

- The second argument, `'N-ZA-Mn-za-m'`, specifies the replacement characters for each character in the range defined in the first argument. This particular sequence is a Caesar cipher with a shift of 13 characters, commonly known as ROT13. It shifts each letter 13 positions forward in the alphabet, wrapping around if necessary. For example, 'A' becomes 'N', 'B' becomes 'O', 'C' becomes 'P', and so on.

![Level-11](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level11-1.png)

---

## Level 12:

**The password for the next level is stored in the file data.txt, which is a hexdump of a file that has been repeatedly compressed. For this level it may be useful to create a directory under /tmp in which you can work using mkdir. For example: mkdir /tmp/myname123. Then copy the datafile using cp, and rename it using mv (read the man pages!)**

```:Password
wbWdlBxEir4CaE8LaPhauuOo6pwRmrDw
```

#### Explanation:

Creating a directory under tmp and copying data.txt file into it because we don’t have permission to write into home directory 🙃

```bash
mkdir /tmp/arcus && cp data.txt /tmp/arcus && cd /tmp/arcus
```

Now lets convert `data.txt` back to its binary form:

```bash
xxd -r data.txt > data
```

`xxd`: is typically used for creating a hex dump of a given file or for converting a hex dump back into its original binary form.

`-r`: This option tells `xxd` to reverse the operation of creating a hex dump and instead convert a hex dump back into binary form.

`> data`: This part of the command is redirecting the output of the xxd command to a file named data. So, the binary data resulting from the conversion will be stored in a file named data.

Now run `file` command on `data` to see its actual file type and change its extension to its actual file type and then decompress it. We have to repeat this process over and over again:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-1.png)

```bash
mv data data.gz
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
gzip -d data.gz
```

Check the file type of `data`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-2.png)

```bash
mv data data.bz2
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
bzip2 -d data.bz2
```

Check the file type of `data`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-3.png)

```bash
mv data data.gz
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
gzip -d data.gz
```

Check the file type of `data`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-4.png)

```bash
mv data data.tar
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
tar -xf data.tar
```

We how have a file named `data5.bin`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-5.png)

```bash
mv data5.bin data5.tar
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
tar -xf data5.tar
```

We how have a file named `data6.bin`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-6.png)

```bash
mv data6.bin data6.bz2
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
bzip2 -d data6.bz2
```

Check the file type of `data6`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-7.png)

```bash
mv data6 data6.tar
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
tar -xf data6.tar
```

We how have a file named `data6.bin`:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-8.png)

```bash
mv data8.bin data8.gz
```

Now, decompress it using this command:

```bash
gzip -d data8.gz
```

Finally, we got an ASCII file, cat that out:

![Level-12](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level12-9.png)

## Level 13:

**The password for the next level is stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and can only be read by user bandit14. For this level, you don’t get the next password, but you get a private SSH key that can be used to log into the next level. Note: localhost is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.**

```:Password
fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq
```

**Note**: This is actual password for bandit level 14

#### Explanation:

To use the private key for **`SSH`** authentication, simply use the `ssh` command with the `-i` flag to specify the path to your private key. i.e., `ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa username@remote_server`

```bash
ssh -i sshkey.private bandit14@localhost -p 2220
```

Now after logging in:

```bash
cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14
```

![Level-13](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level13-1.png)

---

## Level 14:

**The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30000 on localhost.**

```:Password
jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt
```

#### Explanation:

I used netcat for establishing network connection:

```bash
nc localhost 30000
```

Submit password `fGrHPx402xGC7U7rXKDaxiWFTOiF0ENq`

(Remember to stay logged into the server)

![Level-14](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level14-1.png)

---

## Level 15:

**The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.**

```:Password
JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1
```

#### Explanation:

As netcat doesn't have an option for SSL, I used netcat instead to establish a network connection for this task

```bash
ncat --ssl localhost 30001
```

Submit password of current level (`jN2kgmIXJ6fShzhT2avhotn4Zcka6tnt`)

![Level-15](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level15-1.png)

---

## Level 16:

**The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which don’t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.**

```bash
ssh -i key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

#### Explanation

I used `nmap` to scan for open ports. Command that I used:

```bash
nmap localhost -p 31000-32000
```

![Level-16](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level16-1.png)

It will show a list of services. Submit the password of this level (`JQttfApK4SeyHwDlI9SXGR50qclOAil1`) to all of them using:

```bash
ncat --ssl localhost <port-no>
```

One of them (port: `31790`) will give a RSA key.

![Level-16](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level16-2.png)

Copy it to your local machine and set its permission to 400 (`chmod 400 key`) and now connect to level 17 using this RSA key:

```bash
ssh -i key bandit17@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

![Level-16](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level16-3.png)

---

## Level 17:

**There are 2 files in the homedirectory: passwords.old and passwords.new. The password for the next level is in passwords.new and is the only line that has been changed between passwords.old and passwords.new**.

**NOTE: if you have solved this level and see ‘Byebye!’ when trying to log into bandit18, this is related to the next level, bandit19**.

```:Password
hga5tuuCLF6fFzUpnagiMN8ssu9LFrdg
```

#### Explanation:

Man page of `grep`:

![Level-17](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level17-1.png)

I used this command:

```bash
grep -f passwords.old --invert-match passwords.new
```

![Level-17](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level17-2.png)

---

## Level 18:

**The password for the next level is stored in a file readme in the homedirectory. Unfortunately, someone has modified .bashrc to log you out when you log in with SSH.**

```:Password
awhqfNnAbc1naukrpqDYcF95h7HoMTrC
```

#### Explanation:

No problem, if bashrc is corrupted then we can call simple sh (pseudo-shell)

![Level-18](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level18-1.png)

I used this command to get a shell:

```bash
ssh -t bandit18@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220 /bin/sh
```

![Level-18](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level18-2.png)

Rest of challenge is simple.

![Level-18](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level18-3.png)

---

## Level 19:

**To gain access to the next level, you should use the setuid binary in the homedirectory. Execute it without arguments to find out how to use it. The password for this level can be found in the usual place (/etc/bandit_pass), after you have used the setuid binary.**

```:Password
VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT
```

#### Explanation:

Here, you can see an `ELF` named `bandit20-do` with `bandit20`’s user SUID set on it:

![Level-19](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level19-2.png)

![Level-19](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level19-1.png)

To learn about what is SUID and how they can be exploited. [Click here](https://github.com/ArcusTen/Intro-to-CYS-Lab/blob/main/README.md). Anyways, upon running it it tells us how to use it:

![Level-19](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level19-3.png)

So let’s use use it to get `bandit20`’s pasword:

```bash
./bandit20-do cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit20
```

![Level-19](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level19-4.png)

---

## Level 20:

**There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the password for the next level (bandit21).**

**NOTE: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think.**

```:Password
NvEJF7oVjkddltPSrdKEFOllh9V1IBcq
```

#### Explanation:

Set up a netcat listener on your local machine, on any port:

![Level-20](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level20-1.png)

Now set password of current level `VxCazJaVykI6W36BkBU0mJTCM8rR95XT`:

![Level-20](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level20-2.png)

---

## Level 21:

**A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.**

```:Password
WdDozAdTM2z9DiFEQ2mGlwngMfj4EZff
```

#### Explanation:

In `/etc/cron.d` directory, you can find a cronjob for `bandit22` which runs `cronjob_bandit22.sh` script, very minute of every hour of every day. This script is just basically storing password for `bandit22` into another file that is readable by other users.

![Level-21](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level21-1.png)

---

## Level 22:

**A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.**

**NOTE: Looking at shell scripts written by other people is a very useful skill. The script for this level is intentionally made easy to read. If you are having problems understanding what it does, try executing it to see the debug information it prints.**

```:Password
QYw0Y2aiA672PsMmh9puTQuhoz8SyR2G
```

#### Explanation:

In `/etc/cron.d` directory, you can find a cronjob for `bandit23` which runs `cronjob_bandit23.sh` script, very minute of every hour of every day. This script is just basically storing password for `bandit23` into another file named after string "bandit23" MD5 hash value and that file is present in `/tmp` directory. How do I know? Because the script is being run as the user bandit23, who is the owner of this file and the cronjob, the result of the whoami command will be bandit23:

![Level-22](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level22-1.png)

So, to find out the name of the file that has the password for `bandit23` stored in it, I used this command:

```bash
echo "I am user bandit23" | md5sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
```

![Level-22](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level22-2.png)

---

## Level 23:

**A program is running automatically at regular intervals from cron, the time-based job scheduler. Look in /etc/cron.d/ for the configuration and see what command is being executed.**

**NOTE: This level requires you to create your own first shell-script. This is a very big step and you should be proud of yourself when you beat this level!**

**NOTE 2: Keep in mind that your shell script is removed once executed, so you may want to keep a copy around…**

```:Password
VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar
```

#### Explanation:

In `/etc/cron.d` directory, you can find a cronjob for `bandit24` which runs `cronjob_bandit24.sh` script, very minute of every hour of every day. This script is

![Level-23](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level23-1.png)

Contents of `/usr/bin/cronjob_bandit24.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

myname=$(whoami)

cd /var/spool/$myname/foo
echo "Executing and deleting all scripts in /var/spool/$myname/foo:"
for i in * .*;
do
    if [ "$i" != "." -a "$i" != ".." ];
    then
        echo "Handling $i"
        owner="$(stat --format "%U" ./$i)"
        if [ "${owner}" = "bandit23" ]; then
            timeout -s 9 60 ./$i
        fi
        rm -f ./$i
    fi
done
```

This script starts by figuring out the current user's name, then heads over to a specific directory named `/var/spool/$myname/foo`. It goes through all the files in there, even the hidden ones like `.` and `..`, and for each file, it looks at who owns it. If the owner is labeled as `bandit23`, it runs the script but sets a limit of 60 seconds, then promptly removes the script file from the directory.

So, what I will do is first create a directory where everyone can read, write, and execute and I will also create a file in `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` to copy the password of `bandit24` from `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit24` into a file that I can read. Since (according to the cronjob) scripts owned by me will be executed as `bandit24`, I will have no problem executing my script.

Commands will be:

![Level-23](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level23-3.png)

Contents of `/tmp/ineedcontrol/main.sh`:

![Level-23](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level23-2.png)

Save it, copy it to `/var/spool/bandit24/foo` make it executable and wait for 1-2 mints:

![Level-23](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level23-4.png)

And then cat `/tmp/ineedcontrol/pass.txt`:

![Level-23](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level23-5.png)

## Level 24:

**A daemon is listening on port 30002 and will give you the password for bandit25 if given the password for bandit24 and a secret numeric 4-digit pincode. There is no way to retrieve the pincode except by going through all of the 10000 combinations, called brute-forcing.**

**You do not need to create new connections each time**.

```:Password
p7TaowMYrmu23Ol8hiZh9UvD0O9hpx8d
```

#### Explanation:

I wrote a bash script to bruteforce all the possible 10,000 password combinations:

```bash:brute.sh
#!/bin/bash

for i in {0000..9999}
do
	#echo "$i"
	echo "VAfGXJ1PBSsPSnvsjI8p759leLZ9GGar $i"
done | nc localhost 30002
```

Make it executable and run it:

![Level-24](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level24-1.png)

(Remember to do this in a writeable directory, you can create one in `/tmp`.)

## Level 25:

**Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy… The shell for user bandit26 is not /bin/bash, but something else. Find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.**

```:Password
c7GvcKlw9mC7aUQaPx7nwFstuAIBw1o1
```

#### Explanation:

We have a private ssh key for `bandit26`:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-1.png)

Let's try to login using this key:

```bash
ssh -i bandit26.sshkey bandit26@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```

It automatically logs me out when I try to connect to it:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-2.png)

In the challenge description, they said the shell of bandit26 is not a regular bash shell, it's different, so let’s have a look at it first:

```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep "bandit26"
```

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-3.png)

`showtext`?? Never heard of that type of shell.

So, I searched a bit and yes there is no such such type of shell. Let’s have a look at its executable:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-4.png)

So, its basically just using `more` command to read a file named `text.txt` and then exit out with exit code of 0. So that’s why it automatically disconnects when tried to run.

What we need to do is trigger `more` to enter its command mode (Refer to the man page of `more` if you're unfamiliar with command mode), ensuring that the SSH request doesn't simply exit.

Let’s make our terminal as small as possible then ssh in:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-5.png)

So yeah we have successfully launched `more` in its command mode.

That’s the way to break out. **_Very out of the box to get out of the box._**

Now, If we look at the man-page of `more` we can see that by pressing the “v” key (while in interactive mode) it will open the current line in an editor that is defined by the VISUAL and EDITOR environment variables. If both the variables are not set then Vim will be used. Lets see on pressing “v” which editor we get.

And we got vim:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-6.png)

Now, we can open another file using `:e` command.

We want the password for `bandit26` so the command will be:

```bash
:e /etc/bandit_pass/bandit26
```

Run it and we got the password:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-7.png)

but we haven’t got a shell still and when we will ssh into this level it will still kick us out.

Thank God we can call a shell from Vim; otherwise, it would be a hell of a difficulty level.

To get a shell, we will use `:shell` command that vim offers. This command, uses the default shell of user (which in our case is `/usr/bin/showtext`). What we need to do is to set the default shell of the user in vim to actual shell (`/bin/bash`). The command to do that will be `:set shell=/bin/bash` and then now simply call it:

```bash
:shell
```

And we are in:

![Level-25](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level25-8.png)

Tricky challenge I Know. 🙃

## Level 27:

**There is a git repository at** `ssh://bandit27-git@localhost/home/bandit27-git/repo` **via the port** `2220`. **The password for the user** `bandit27-git` **is the same as for the user** `bandit27`.

**Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.**

```:Password
AVanL161y9rsbcJIsFHuw35rjaOM19nR

UMMM.

Let’s have a look at logs:

![Level-28](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level28-3.png)

Let’s check the commit `add missing data`:

![Level-28](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level28-4.png)

Now, cat that again:

```

#### Explanation:

By now you should know how to clone a repository. In the cloned repo, we have `README.md` file. Cat that out:

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-1.png)

Hmmmm. Let’s have a look at logs:

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-2.png)

Let’s check the “initial commit”:

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-3.png)

Now, cat that again. Nope same output:

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-4.png)

Let’s see what other branches we have:

```bash
git branch -r
```

We are currently on `master`.

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-5.png)

Let's switch to the `dev` branch and see what they have for us there:

```bash
git checkout dev
```

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-6.png)

Let’s cat this `README.md` file:

![Level-29](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level29-7.png)

#### Explanation:

In the cloned repo, we have `README.md` file. Cat that out:

![Level-30](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level30-1.png)

Hmmmm. Let’s have a look at logs:

![Level-30](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level30-2.png)

We are already on the “initial commit”. Let’s see what other branches we have:

```bash
git branch -r
```

We are currently on `master` and we have no other branches:

![Level-30](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level30-3.png)

Let's check `tags`. In git, tags are used to mark specific points in history such as release versions for easy reference.

![Level-30](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level30-4.png)

We have one tag named `secret`. Let's see what it is and here is the password:

![Level-30](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level30-5.png)

## Level 31:

**There is a git repository at `ssh://bandit31-git@localhost/home/bandit31-git/repo` via the port `2220`. The password for the user `bandit31-git` is the same as for the user `bandit31`.**

**Clone the repository and find the password for the next level.**

```:Password
rmCBvG56y58BXzv98yZGdO7ATVL5dW8y
```

#### Explanation:

Contents of `README.md` file:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-1.png)

Let’s have a look at logs:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-2.png)

We are already on the “initial commit”. Let’s see what other branches we have:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-2.png)

We are currently on `master` and we have no other branches plus the `README` file says that the `key.txt` is in master branch:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-3.png)

Look what I found:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-4.png)

`.gitignore` files are used to specify intentionally untracked files and directories that Git should ignore, preventing them from being staged or committed. They help maintain clean repositories by filtering out files like build artifacts, temporary files etc. In our case, it includes `*.txt`, which means it will ignore all text files. That's why we can't find the `key.txt` file.

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-5.png)

To retrieve password, remove the `.gitignore` file and create a `key.txt` file with content specified in the `README.md` file:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-6.png)

Stage it, commit and push to the repo:

![Level-31](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level31-7.png)

Here is the password:

## Level 32:

**After all this `git` stuff its time for another escape. Good luck!**

```:Password
odHo63fHiFqcWWJG9rLiLDtPm45KzUKy
```

#### Explanation:

For this level, we got a weird shell "**THE UPPERCASE SHELL**". That just capitalize whatever command is passed to it:

![Level-32](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level32-1.png)

So basically, what's going on is that this shell we are looking at is just a binary file. It takes whatever we type in, switches it to uppercase and then tells shell to run it as a command. Remember how we check what shell we have by running `echo "$0"`:

![Level-32](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/shell.png)

This is because variable `$0` stores the name of the file orscript that is currently being executed. If we run `echo "$0"` in the terminal, we will see that we are getting the name of the currently used shell. But if we just run `$0`, it spawns a new shell(`zsh`):

![Level-32](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/demo.png)

Let's try out this theory in level 32:

![Level-32](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level32-2.png)

We got a stable shell. Plus, here is the password:

![Level-32](/static/writeups/overthewire/bandit/bandit-level32-3.png)

**_EASY..._**
