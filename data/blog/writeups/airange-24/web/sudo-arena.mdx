## Challenge Description

Why was the admin at Area 51 so efficient? Because they had their `ID` on an alien database.

## Solution

I had first blood on this web challenge.

In this challenge, I initially thought that it is some sort of SQL injection challenge.

But it wasn‚Äôt.

After some tries and getting responses saying ‚ÄúInvalid Credentials‚Äù, I thought why not fuzz its directories?

I used `ffuf` with **`rockyou.txt`** as wordlist to do that but you can use `gobuster` if you want.

Command that I used:

```python
ffuf -u http://143.198.227.172:5000/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -recursion | tee ffuf.log
```

Here, I found 3 interesting results:

The **`/login`** page is where we were redirected to display the ‚ÄúInvalid Credentials‚Äù message, while the **`/account`** page is requesting an API key:

After that when I checked **`/admin`** page, I found a gist link in its source code:

It is a link to a SQL code. From here I got the admin‚Äôs password:

After logging in, I was prompted this:

Basically it was a page that said clicked me to get flag.

I intercepted that GET request because it is obvious that we have to make a GET request to fetch api key:

So, the challenge is that I have to make GET request that will fetch the API Key for EX-Worker but the problem is IDK the location where api data is stored.

I did a simple google search on where are api information stored in `Werkzeug/3.0.1 Python/3.9.18`

And I saw this github [issue](https://github.com/apache/superset/issues/25890) where many users are having issues while fetching data from `/api/v1/` when GET request is made using user with Superset predefined Admin role in Python.

So, I thought why not give it a try.

For that let‚Äôs first find out which worker was fired.

On the gist, in revisions section, you can see elonmusk was fired üòÇ:

So elonmusk is behind all of this.

Now its time to get api key for elonmusk.

First I tried this GET request but it didn‚Äôt worked:

After trying different combinations and different query parameters I got success when I made request to `/api/account`:

After entering key, here is the flag:

Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have fired Elon Musk üòÇ

Flag:

```
AUCSS{ap1_h7ck3R_w1Th_JU$T_s0M3_G1$Ts_m@g1c}
```

Bonus:

As no authentication is required to make such a request, you can use curl command to do the same thing

```python
curl "http://143.198.227.172:5000/api/account?id=elonmusk"
```

## Reviews:

It was a tricky challenge that required guessing, and most people wouldn't approach it the way I did. Many developers keep their API Keys in Environment variables and Configuration files. Luckily, I had faced a similar challenge before while playing a private room on TryHackMe. Otherwise, I don't think I would have been able to solve it.
