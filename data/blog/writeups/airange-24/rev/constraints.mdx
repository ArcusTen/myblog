## Solution

My friend Kumail and I solved this challenge together.

First of all open the compiled code in ghidra. Here, in the main function, we can see that **`verify`** function is called by providing key (entered by the user) as argument/parameters:

The key verification process is performed by the `verify` function, which takes four integers extracted from the key input. The function performs several arithmetic operations and checks if the result matches certain values.

Given the constraints within the **`verify`** function, we can represent the problem as a set of equations:

To efficiently solve these equations, we employ the Z3 theorem prover, a powerful tool for constraint solving. I used pythonâ€™s Z3 library to find the values of the four integers required for a valid key:

```python:constraints-solver
from z3 import *

var1, var2, var3, var4 = Ints('var1 var2 var3 var4')

# Defining constraints
constraints = [
    (var3 + var1 * var2) - var4 == 873457778,
    var2 - var1 == 24297,
    (var3 * -5) + var4 == -378312,
    (var2 + var4) % 100000 == 16595
]

# Creating a solver instance
solver = Solver()

# Add constraints to the solver
solver.add(constraints)

# Checking if the constraints are satisfiable
if solver.check() == sat:
    # Getting the satisfying model
    model = solver.model()

    # Extracting values of variables
    valVar1 = model[var1].as_long()
    valVar2 = model[var2].as_long()
    valVar3 = model[var3].as_long()
    valVar4 = model[var4].as_long()

    # Printing key
    print(str(valVar1) + "-" + str(valVar2) + "-" + str(valVar3) + "-" + str(valVar4))
else:
    print("Constraints are unsatisfiable.")
```

Execute the Python script, which will compute the values of the four integers based on the provided constraints:

Running against remote server to get the flag:

Flag:

```
